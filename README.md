# Sc-RNA-seq-Analysis
The aim of this work is to analyse the hypotalamic region of Mus Musculus to identify the different type of cells present in the sample. 

The data used for this project are 5265 cells from the hypothalamus of mus musculus. The approach that was used to perform scRNA-seq is 10x Genomics Chromium. According to PanglaoDB the cell types present in this samples are:

- Astrocytes n=183

- Endothelial cells n=128

- Macrophages n=20

- Microglia n=152

- Neurons n=3241

- Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells n=239

- Oligodendrocytes n=950

- Smooth muscle cells n=91
